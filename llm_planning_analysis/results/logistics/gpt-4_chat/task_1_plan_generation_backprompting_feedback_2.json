location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at
